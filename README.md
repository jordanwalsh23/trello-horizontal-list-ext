# Trello Horizontal List Extension

As published in the [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello-horizontal-plugin/bnjapjcicacmalbgnpnfgclacakagnli?hl=en&gl=AU).

This plugin converts trello from a vertical list layout to a horizontal list layout.

This is perfect for designers who would like to compare lists visually going across the page rather than down the page.
